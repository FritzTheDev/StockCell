#StockCell
StockCell's a really basic python utility I developed to explore API usage and OOP
##Functionality
It pulls data from the Alpha Vantage API and takes user input to access data for any given ticker on a chosen trading day.
##How to use
Clone the repo, then run the .exe, which works even without a python installation or the module dependencies. You'll get a command line prompt asking you to input a stock ticker. **BE PRECISE ON EVERY INPUT**, there is no validation yet. You'll then be prompted to input the trading day you want to check. **YOU MUST USE ISO FORMAT** i.e. YYYY-MM-DD, including the dashes. If you've made it this far without crashing the program, you'll be prompted with a y/n, asking if you want to add another ticker. **ANY INPUT BUT 'Y' WILL CLOSE THE PROGAM**
